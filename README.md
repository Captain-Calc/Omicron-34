# Omicron-34
A puzzle game for the TI-84 Plus CE

## Installation

Send the following files to your calculator using TI Connect CE:

* MICRON34.8xp
* OmicronC.8xv
* OmicronU.8xv

You will also need the latest C libraries installed on your calculator.
You can find them here: https://github.com/CE-Programming/libraries/releases

## Gameplay:

Omicron 34 consists of two different puzzles, or challenges, with ten levels (weeks)
of difficulty. The backstory is that you are a special agent applicant to Omicron 34,
a DoD, online special agent academy. Using the hypothetical, advanced networking powers
of your TI-84 Plus CE, you are able to log into the academy right from your own room and
learn the skills you need to become a chief intelligence officer. Have fun!

### Lock Picking Challenge:

In this puzzle, you need to solve a lock by moving the lock pins up or down with the
aid of a clue. The clues are encoded in Pig Latin, riddles, and the Major System (a
memory aid for converting numbers into words). In the last level, one of the clues is
encoded first in Major and then in Pig Latin (Hint: you translate the Pig Latin first).
You can access the codebook in the control panel by pressing [zoom]. This contains
keys to help you solve the Pig Latin and Major System clues. The codebook can also be
expanded by purchasing upgrades from the Shop.

### Computer Hacking Challenge:

This puzzle will try your memory skills as you hack into computer files while avoiding
the Anti-Spyware scanner that is waiting to catch you! At the start of each attempt,
you will briefly see two to four red boxes around some of the file names in the list
on the left. These files are being scanned. Your job is to hack a certain number of
the unscanned files, shown by the "Goal:" number on the left of the control panel. If
you accidently attempt to hack a scanned file, the alarm will sound and you will lose
points. You can purchase an Anti-Scanner tool from the Shop that will allow you to see
the scanned files again when you press [zoom]. Each time you use the tool, however, it
must recharge in order to be used again.
